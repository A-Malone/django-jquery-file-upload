[jQuery-File-Upload](http://aquantum-demo.appspot.com/file-upload) is developed by Sebastian Tschan, with the source available on [github](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload). Example code is [ported to Django](https://github.com/sigurdga/django-jquery-file-upload) by Sigurd Gartmann ([sigurdga on github](https://github.com/sigurdga/)).

Introduction
============

This is a small example on how to setup Sebastian Tschan's jQuery File Upload in Django. He has a working demo on his [webpage](http://aquantum-demo.appspot.com/file-upload) and a [github repository](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload) with an example on how to do it in PHP.

Here, you'll find a minimal Django project with a minimal app. You can run the example standalone by cloning the repository, running the migrations and starting the server.

Detailed instructions will probably be posted when the delete part (the only missing part) and image resize is finished.

I want to give a thank to Sebastian Tschan, the original author, and Jørgen Bergquist for helping me over the first hurdles.
